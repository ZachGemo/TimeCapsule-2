    Welcome to The Purchase Hunt.
    You've just opened a time capsule which has been locked away for 10 years. In the spring of 2019, four students got together to make a location-specific time capsule, each unique to the Purchase campus. We've given you one time capsule to start with. Look through clues to find the others' time capsules and complete the treasure hunt. Or, if you happen to be on campus you may access each time capsule when you reach the respective destination.<br><br>
    Each of these time capsules answers the following questions:<br>
      Why did you pick this location?<br>
      Is this space associated with negative or positive experiences?<br>
      Who are the people who shaped your experience in that space?<br>
      What did you take away from your experience in this location?<br>
      What would you tell someone who is occupying the space 10 years from now?
    <br><br>
    This is a collaborative project between Design for Screens with Kelsey Elder and Scripting for the Web with Lee Tusman of Spring 2019. Made by: Camaryn Franchi, Zach Gemo, Emily Bottner, and Wadiah Mohammad.
